# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13 Mapping Earthquakes with JS &amp; API's
This module layed out how to create branches within github, and navigating through them, as well as merging and pushing them to the main branch fo the github repo. We also used MapBox APIs, Leaflet, and most importantley GeoJSONs. GeoJSONs are a very flexable tool that will apply the data given to the map that you have created with a minimum of coding and formatting. We also practiced coding in JavaScript, which if i'm honest, i do not care for. We need to have a passing knowledge of JS to compete in a data science career, but i'm ready to move on to bigger and better things, Tableau where have you been all my life?
